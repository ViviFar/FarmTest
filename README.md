# FarmTest
This is my implementation for the technical test

How to play:

Tap on a seed in the market place and then on one of the available zone in a field to buy and plant a seed
Harvest on time to get full selling price, on rotting phase to get 1/2 of buying price (rounded down) or wait for it to decay.
Buy new fields by tapping them when you got enough money
